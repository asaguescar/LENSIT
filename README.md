# LENSIT: Lensing End-to-end Supernovae Lightcurve Investigation Tool

This is an end-to-end pipeline to simulate realistic unresolved lensed supernovae lightcurves. 
It combines survey observing logs with a population of synthetic supernova lightcurves, vombines with a distribution of lens properties. 
The assumptions are part of the inputs for the simualtions. Therefore this pipeline allows to investigate effects on the lensing properties to the lightcurves. 

It utilized existing python packages like LENSTRONOMY, to solve the lensing equations and SKYSURVEY, to simulate the lightcurves for the given survey.
